# hello-world
hello-world sample git project

I have absolutely no idea what I'm supposed to write about here. I wonder if there's a bot that randomly reads what everyone wrote in their first hello-world project and collates it somewhere....

also when I make comments that invite thought, I use four periods, not three....
